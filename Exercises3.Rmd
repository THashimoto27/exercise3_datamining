#1) What causes what?

## 1-1 Why we can't regress crime on police?

Because we can't misunderstand the causal effect between crime and police. As the podcast said, in Washington DC, a lot of extra police officers are hired even if the crime rate is low because of preparing terrorism. However, in general, high crime cities have an incentive to hire a lot of cops. Therefore, if you regress crime on police in a few different cities like DC, you probably misunderstand the effect. So you can't do this.

## 1-2 How can a professor identify the causal effect?

They found that when the terror alert level goes up, extra police are put on the mall in other parts of Washington to protect against terrorists has nothing to do with street crime. Also then, the streets were safer(the number of murder, robbery, assault goes down).

To show this causality, they regressed the crime on the High Alert, and got the result of the Table 2. This background of the regression is as follow:

At first, they thought this structure, where the outcome $y$ is crime, a variable that want to shows the causality $x$, and a instrument variable $z$ is the High Alert.

```{r, echo=FALSE,out.width = '40%',fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("./fig/1.png")
```

Because of the endogeneity, they cannot direct regress $y$ on $x$, but they selected the High Alert as $z$ that is positive correlated with $x$. And then they used regress $y$ on $z$ with reduced form like: 

$$
\begin{aligned}
y_{crime}=\gamma_0+\gamma_1z_{\{High\ Alert\}}+\varepsilon
\end{aligned}
$$

where $\beta_1\pi_1$ and $x_{police}=\pi_0+\pi_1z_{\{High\ Alert\}}+v$.
Since the $x$ and $z$ are positive correlated, the coefficient of the High Alert on Table 2 shows $\beta_1<0$. This means that on the high-alert days, total crimes decrease by an average of seven crimes per day, or approximately 6.6 percent. Also, it means that the more police causes the less crime.

## 1-3 Why Metro ridership? What was captured?

According to their talks, they concerned about the possibility that tourist were less likely to visit Washington DC if the High Alert was announced, and what tourist were less likely to visit caused less crime. To check this hypothesis, they added a variable of the scaled Metro Ridership into the regression model.

And then, they found that the coefficient of the High Alert is still negative even if they added its variable. Therefore, they concluded that if the same number of tourists, the more police causes the less crime as well as the result 1-2.

### 1-4

This model is DID model, which control group is other district and treatment group is District 1.

And, the difference between the High Alert $\times$ District One and the High Alert $\times$ Other Districts coefficients represents the effect of District 1 on the crime under the setting that controls for all common factors between the districts. They found that even after controlling for all such factors and recognizing that our assumption is too strong, we still find that crime decreases in District 1 during high-alert periods by some two crimes per day, or more than 12 percent.
